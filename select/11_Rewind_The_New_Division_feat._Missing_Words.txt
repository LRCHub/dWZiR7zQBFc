I'll find some way back home
I'll find, I'll find my way back home
To you
Married man
I'll try to sell ourselves to the one
I promise I'll be there
I'll try to see the world through your eyes
I'll try to find some hope inside
To last
To know what's on your mind
When you say you can't get it right
Now I'm on your car, your design to go astray
Hold on to what you know,
There's no moments in time
Hold on, just take it slow
We'll get it right

So, what's on your mind?
Are you trying to break away?
I can't even rewind to all those better days
Hold on to what you know,
There's no moments in time
Hold on, just take it slow
We'll get it right

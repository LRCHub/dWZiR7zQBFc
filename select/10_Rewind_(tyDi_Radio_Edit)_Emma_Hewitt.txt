I see the flashing lights through the pouring rain
I've been awake all night now I'm on my feet again
So many years ago I've been down these streets
And I'm taking my time though I know they're waiting for me...

Rewind us for a day
Remind me why we changed...

I got a beat of a drum going through my head
I feel it echo on like all those words you said
It's like nothing's changed and there's a trick being played on me
But I'm a lifetime away from where I need to be...

Rewind us for a day
Remind me why we changed...
Rewind us for a day
Remind me why we changed...

Rewind us for a day
Remind me why we changed...
Rewind us for a day
Remind me why we changed...
Rewind us for a day

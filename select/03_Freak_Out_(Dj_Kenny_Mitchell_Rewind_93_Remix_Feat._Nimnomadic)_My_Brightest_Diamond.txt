I think we should jump on the piano
No one's looking we could tear his heart out
Tear his heart out

It's too late to save us now but no matter
We still have time to dance
So let's dance

And freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
Freak out, freak out

I think we should rip a hole
Right through the center of this house
It's time to tear it down
Our chance to smoke him out

It's too late to save us now but no matter
We still have time to dance
So let's dance

And freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out

Come on let's put off all our hesitation
And get up on the floor
'Cause I am gonna laugh ha ha hey
When you do that dance
And freak out
Come on freak out
Freak out

Play back, wish that we could play back
Moments we would lay back
I used to call you home
Patience, wish we had more patience
Sticky situations
I want to call you home

Whether, whether we go wrong
Whether, whether this is done
The silence always hits me hard
When I'm by myself, when I'm by myself

I don't needa, I don't needa think on rewind
Think on rewind
I don't needa, I don't need another quiet night
Another quiet night

Changes, don't like when it changes
Wake up in unknown places
Nowhere feels like home

Whether, whether we go wrong
Whether, whether this is done
The silence always hits me hard
When I'm by myself, when I'm by myself

I don't needa, I don't needa think on rewind
Think on rewind
I don't needa, I don't need another quiet night
Another quiet night
I don't needa, I don't needa think on rewind
Think on rewind
I don't needa, I don't need another quiet night
Another quiet night

Play back, wish that we could play back
Moments we would lay back
Nowhere feels like home
